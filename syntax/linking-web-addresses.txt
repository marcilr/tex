"Linking web addresses


Links to a web address or email can added to a LATEX file using 
the \url command to display the actual link or \href to use a 
\hidden link and show a word/sentence instead.

For further references see \href{http://www.sharelatex.com}{Something Linky} 
or go to the next url: \url{http://www.sharelatex.com}

There are two commands in the example that generate a link in 
the final document:

\href{http://www.sharelatex.com}{Something Linky}

There are two parameters passed to this command, the first one 
is the url to the link, http://www.sharelatex.com in this case, 
and the second one is the clickable text to be shown, 
Something Linky.

\url{http://www.sharelatex.com}

This command will show the url passed as parameter and make it 
into a link, useful if you will print the document."
