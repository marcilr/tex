Add path to LaTeX build
=======================
Never got LaTeX's --include-directory=dir command line
aregument to work.

Added desired macros to path under $(HOME)/texmf/tex/latex/ 
The macros which are pulled in automatedly found by LaTeX 
build.  The "/tex/latex/" suffix is required.  Added all macros, 
except rcs, under 00MACROS/ directory.
