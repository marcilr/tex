\input


The \input is extremely useful for making hierarctical
latex files.  Component file can be included verbatim 
with the \input tag.  Very useful.


how to use \input{file.tex} correctly?
======================================
The best thing is probably to leave out the document preamble
and the \begin{document} and \end{document} from the included
files and have one master file that sets up the style.


Master file:

\documentclass{article}
% preamble.
\begin{document}
    \input{file1}
    \input{file2}
\end{document}


First included file:

\section{Blah}
% more stuff.


Second included file

\section{More stuff}
% blah blah

When should I use \input vs. \include?
======================================
\input{filename} imports the commands from filename.tex into
the target file; it's equivalent to typing all the commands
from filename.tex right into the current file where the \input
line is.

\include{filename} essentially does a \clearpage before and
after \input{filename}, together with some magic to switch to 
another .aux file, and omits the inclusion at all if you have
an \includeonly without the filename in the argument.  This is
primarily useful when you have a big project on a slow computer;
changing one of the include targets won't force you to
regenerate the outputs of all the rest.

\include{filename} gets you the speed bonus, but it also can't
be nested, can't appear in the preamble, and forces page breaks
 around the included text.
