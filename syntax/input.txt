\input


The \input is extremely useful for making hierarctical
latex files.  Component file can be included verbatim 
with the \input tag.  Very useful.


how to use \input{file.tex} correctly?
======================================
The best thing is probably to leave out the document preamble
and the \begin{document} and \end{document} from the included
files and have one master file that sets up the style.


Master file:

\documentclass{article}
% preamble.
\begin{document}
    \input{file1}
    \input{file2}
\end{document}


First included file:

\section{Blah}
% more stuff.


Second included file

\section{More stuff}
% blah blah
