What is the difference between “Page Break” and “New Page”? [duplicate]

If you use \newpage, the page will be directly "cut off" and a new one
will begin.  The text/paragraphs on the page will not be affected in
any way. If you do this, you might have a lot of empty space on that page.

With \pagebreak, the paragraphs on the cut page will spread out over
the page, so you will not have empty space at the bottom.  The old page
will not look like it is the end of a chapter.
