Adding unnumbered sections to TOC

Previous I used section* to remove the section number from the
Appendix.  However, this had the side affect of removing the 
Appendix from the TOC (Table of Contents).

Typically I have create an unnumbered Appendix using:
  \section*{Appendix}

The best solution is use of secnumdepth such that sections like Appendix
will not get numbered:

setcounter{secnumdepth}{0}    <=== Disable section numbering
\section{Appendix}

\setcounter{secnumdepth}{1}   <=== Enable section numbering
\section{Appendix}
