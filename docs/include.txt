When should I use \input vs. \include?


There are two different commands to incorporate another file into
the source of some document, \input and \include. When should I
use one or the other?  What are the differences between them?
Are there more things like them to be aware of?


\input{filename} imports the commands from filename into the target
file; it's equivalent to typing all the commands from filename right
into the current file where the \input line is \include{filename}
essentially does a \clearpage before and after \input{filename},
together  with some magic to switch to another .aux file, and omit
the inclusion at all if you have an \includeonly without the filename
in the argument.  This is primarily useful when you have a big project
on a slow computer; changing one of the include targets won't force
you to regenerate the outputs of all the rest \include gets you the
speed bonus, but it also can't be nested, can't appear in the preamble,
and forces page breaks around the included text.


NOTE: Have not seen \include{filename} work yet.
      \input{filename} is working in
