Endnotes in LaTeX
==================
June 6, 2006 in LaTeX, Tips

A commonly asked question with an easy answer: how do I use
endnotes rather than footnotes in a LaTeX document?

In your document's preamble, invoke the endnotes package:

  \usepackage{endnotes}

The endnotes package is included automatically in most LaTeX
distributions. To insert a new endnote in your document, use
the command:

  \endnote{Text here}

And at the point in your document where you want the endnotes
to appear, type:

  \theendnotes

which will insert a list of your endnotes and an automatic
heading.

Notes ==> nothing
=================
The \endnotes package \theendnotes used to lay down the actual
endnotes always places a "Notes" section heading.  No good when
you already have an "Endnotes" section.  The solution is to use
\notesname variagle to change the endnotes section heading.
To change the heading to nothing use:

\vspace{-10 mm}              <== Remove whitespace to get proper spacing.
\renewcommand{\notesname}{}


Introduced \notesname in the spirit of international \LaTeX.
\notesname is set per default to be {Notes}, but can easily
be redifined, e.g. for german language
\renewcommand{\notesname}{Anmerkungen}

Reset note count
================
You may want separate endnotes for each chapter, or a big block
of them at the end of the whole document.  Either will work, you
just put \theendnotes wherever you want the endnotes so far to
be inserted, which will insert a list of your endnotes and an
automatic heading ("Notes").  However, you must add
\setcounter{endnote}{0} after that if you want subsequent endnotes
to start numbering at 1 again.

In 00MANIFESTOS/blackboard/blackboard-manifesto.tex I used
\setcounter{endnote}{1} after use of \endnotemark[1] to punch
up the numbering, to 2, since it did not occur automatically.
