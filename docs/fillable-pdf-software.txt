Is there software that can fill PDF forms? - Ask Ubuntu
"Document Viewer (Evince) SHOULD be able to fill in forms, 
IF the document is a fillable form. Not all documents are 
fillable! If document does not support form filling the form, 
you should use tools like PDFedit or OpenOffice Draw"

'Evince 3.18.2 let me very easily put text into a form on a 
US tax document and save it. Opening the file in xpdf, I can 
see the edits. Not sure if it's filling the forms the "right way", 
but the spacing and font look great in this limited test. –

'update. "Master PDF Editor 3" enables pdf form fields to be 
entered by the user. It works well to fill forms, remove/add 
pages, reorder, add comments, etc. It should be listed in 
ubuntu software centre, else search for the deb file online.
