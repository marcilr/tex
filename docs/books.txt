The LaTeX Companions Third Revised Boxed Set: A Complete Guide and Reference for Preparing,
Illustrating and Publishing Technical Documents (2nd Edition) [Paperback]
This attractively priced boxed set brings together four leading books on the LaTeX software
system for typesetting documents, covering all you need to know about LaTeX.  Because LaTeX is
especially good for technical documents and is freely available for almost any computer system,
it has become a lingua franca of the scientific world.  The first book in the set, Guide to LaTeX,
4/e , shows you how to begin using LaTeX, and also serves as a handy reference.  The next three
books, whose authors have taken a lead role in the development and dissemination of LaTeX's most
recent versions, are The LaTeX Companion, 2/e , The Latex Graphics Companion, 2/e , and The LaTeX
Web Companion.  They provide further information on tools and techniques available for more
complex typesetting needs, for incorporating graphics into documents, and for publishing technical
text on the Web.  Whether you are new to LaTeX or want to be sure that your LaTeX library is
current and complete, you will find a useful place for this set on your reference shelf.
