You can also use the verbatim environment for larger pieces
of text that you need to format.  There are begin/end constructs
to let Mosaic (or other browser) as in:

    \begin{verbatim}
        : 
    bunch of things
        : 
    \end{verbatim} 

Everything in the verbatim environment is printed exactly as is.
Note, however, that tabs are ignored, so be sure to use spaces
to position text.  Also, you cannot center verbatim text, but
you can quote it:

    \begin{quote} 
    \begin{verbatim}
        : 
    \end{verbatim} 
    \end{quote} 

Note that everything in verbatim is in typewriter font, and that
no LaTeX commands are recognized as such.
