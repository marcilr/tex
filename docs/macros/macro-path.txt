Include macros in LaTeX macro path?


One of my long outstanding questions is how to pull directories
with arbitrary macros into the LaTeX macro path for inclusion.
Seems I've figured this out a couple times.

The commands used to build latex documents are:
  /usr/bin/bibtex   <=== Process \citation entries for bibliography.
  /usr/bin/latex    <=== Create dvi from tex
  /usr/bin/dvips    <=== Create ps from dvi
  /usr/bin/ps2pdf   <=== Create pdf from ps


o Use of TEXINPUTS to specify LaTex's path:

  house/landlord/lease/Makefile:14
  # NOTE: Use of TEXINPUTS to specify additional directory for style files.
  LATEX  = export TEXINPUTS=.:../latex:;latex

o Macros can be in the same current working directory as the tex
  document such as fullpage.sty pulled into the LaTeX document with:

  \usepackage{fullpage}   <== Pull in fullpage.sty from working directory.

o LaTeX macros under standard $(HOME)/texmf/tex/latex/ are pulled in,
  with no extra effort, by LaTeX build.  Sweet.
