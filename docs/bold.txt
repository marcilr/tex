Bold text

To create bold text in LaTeX use {\bf text}.

E.g., in the output sequence ``Hello World!'', if you wish
the word ``Hello'' to be in bold font, your latex file will
contain the sequence
  
  {\bf Hello} World!

Note that \bf is a latex command to change the font to bold
face.  The curly brackets {...} is latex's way of isolating
the context of the bold face.
