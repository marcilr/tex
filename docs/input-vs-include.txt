\input{filename} vs. \include{filename}


\input{filename} imports the commands from filename.tex
into the target file; it's equivalent to typing all the
commands from filename.tex right into the current file
where the \input line is.

\include{filename} essentially does a \clearpage before
and after \input{filename}, together with some magic to
switch to another .aux file, and omits the inclusion at
all if you have an \includeonly without the filename in
the argument.  This is primarily useful when you have a
big project on a slow computer; changing one of the
include targets won't force you to regenerate the
outputs of all the rest.

\include{filename} gets you the speed bonus, but it
also can't be nested, can't appear in the preamble,
and forces page breaks around the included text.

NOTE: \newpage is embedded at the beginning of
      included sections as needed.
