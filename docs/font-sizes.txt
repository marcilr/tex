Latex provides 10 different font sizes.  To change the size of
a font use a new font size parameter.  The different font sizes
are listed below.

Font Sizes
 1. \tiny
 2. \scriptsize
 3. \footnotesize
 4. \small
 5. \normalsize
 6. \large
 7. \Large
 8. \LARGE
 9. \huge
10. \Huge 

All of these fonts are listed from smallest to largest.
To change the size of the font use a '\' followed by one
of the above font sizes before the TEXT you want to change.
