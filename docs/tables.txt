Creating Tables with LaTeX
Tables are created using the "table" environment given below:

  \begin{table}[where]
    table
  \end{table}

In the above syntax, table stands for the contents of the "tabular"
environment together with a possible \caption command. The argument
where specifies the allowed locations for the table.  For example,
when \begin{table}[t] is typed, it means that the table will appear
on the top of the page.
