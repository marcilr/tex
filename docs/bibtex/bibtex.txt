How to Use BibTeX

BibTeX can be amazing if you use it properly.  It is a very powerful way to cite sources and
compile a bibliography in a LaTeX document.  Here, I provide you with my non-fail guide to BibTeX.

BibTeX relies on a database file.  How this works is personal preference.  You can have one
database file for each document you write, or you can do what I do and have one database file,
period.  This way I can have a huge database and pluck out the papers I need from it.
