How to Use BibTeX
=================
BibTeX can be amazing if you use it properly.  It is a very powerful way to cite sources and
compile a bibliography in a LaTeX document. Here,  I provide you with my non-fail guide to BibTeX.

BibTeX relies on a database file.  How this works is personal preference.  You can have one
database file for each document you write, or you can do what I do and have one database file,
period. This way I can have a huge database and pluck out the papers I need from it.


Creating a Database
===================
A database is simply a text file with the extension '.bib'.  Each entry in the database starts
with the '@' symbol.  Usually when referencing a journal, it will begin with @ARTICLE.  Each
database entry is rather complex, here is a sample:

@ARTICLE{2011A&A...525A.143C,
   author = {{Cassata}, P. and {Le F{\`e}vre}, O. and {Garilli}, B. and {Maccagni}, D. and 
	{Le Brun}, V. and {Scodeggio}, M. and {Tresse}, L. and {Ilbert}, O. and 
	{Zamorani}, G. and {Cucciati}, O. and {Contini}, T. and {Bielby}, R. and 
	{Mellier}, Y. and {McCracken}, H.~J. and {Pollo}, A. and {Zanichelli}, A. and 
	{Bardelli}, S. and {Cappi}, A. and {Pozzetti}, L. and {Vergani}, D. and 
	{Zucca}, E.},
    title = "{The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey: star formation rate density of Ly{$\alpha$} emitters from a sample of 217 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts 2 {\le} z {\le} 6.6}",
  journal = {\aap},
archivePrefix = "arXiv",
   eprint = {1003.3480},
 primaryClass = "astro-ph.CO",
 keywords = {cosmology: observations, galaxies: fundamental parameters, galaxies: evolution, galaxies: formation},
     year = 2011,
    month = jan,
   volume = 525,
    pages = {A143+},
      doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201014410},
   adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...525A.143C},
  adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}
}
Most of this is self-explanatory.  It should be mentioned that the text coming directly after
@ARTICLE{ is the name you will use in the LaTeX file to reference that paper using the \cite{}
command.  So, how do you easily generate these bibTeX entries?  ADS does it for you!  Navigate to
the ADS page of the paper you want to reference and click the link called "Bibtex entry for this
abstract" (it is directly after the abstract).  Copy/paste it into your database file and you're
done.


Setting up for BibTeX
=====================
Before you begin editing your LaTeX file, be sure you have the correct bibTeX style file either in
the current working directory or in LaTeX's path.  The ApJ file can be found here:
http://ads.harvard.edu/pubs/bibtex/astronat/apj/apj.bst.  Other journals will have different .bst
files.  The first thing you need to do in your LaTeX file is add the following three lines after
your \documentclass statement:

\usepackage{natbib}
\bibliographystyle{apj}
\citestyle{aa}


Citations
=========
Next, you can add citations to your work. There are various \cite* commands, however the two I use
are \citet and \citep (\citealt and \citealp do not put any parentheses in at all).  The only
difference is where the parentheses are placed. For example (using the bibTeX entry above):

\citet{2011A&A...525A.143C}
   Cassata et al. (2011)

\citep{2011A&A...525A.143C}
   (Cassata et al. 2011)

Note that adding a * (such as \citet* or \citep*) will display all of the authors instead of et
al'ing.  Also, you can have multiple citations in the same \cite command by seperating them with
commas.  You can add text before and after a citation with the bracket commands.  The first [ ]
corresponds to leading text, the second [ ] corresponds to trailing text (note with only one
bracket, it will be at the end):

\citep[see][]{2011A&A...525A.143C}
   (see Cassata et al. 2011)

\citep[see][p. 64]{2011A&A...525A.143C}
   (see Cassata et al. 2011, p. 64)

\citep[hereafter C2011]{2011A&A...525A.143C}
   (Cassata et al. 2011, hereafter C2011)

There are also specialized commands:

\citeauthor{2011A&A...525A.143C}
   Cassata et al.

\citeyear{2011A&A...525A.143C}
   2011

\citeyearpar{2011A&A...525A.143C}
   (2011)


Bibliography
============
Now we let the power of bibTeX shine and have it generate the entire bibliography.  It will only
generate entries if it has cited them in the text of the document and it will always arrange them
in alphabetical order.  To generate the bibliography, use (assuming we named the database file
refs.bib):

\bibliography{refs}


Generating the Final File
=========================
Just a quick note, ALWAYS process your files twice so the references can all cross-reference each
other. Never generate it only once.


A Quick Note about TeXShop for Mac OS
=====================================
As of Version 2.41 of TeXShop, the above prescription may or may not work.  When one tries to
compile the bibliography (command + Shift + B) there may be an error message stating that no
\citation commands were found.  This can be rectified by pasting anywhere in your code (using the
above example):

\nocite{2011A&A...525A.143C}

This will tell TeXShop to look for that reference, but it will never actually print anything.
You must do this for all references you make in your paper.  What I do is use bibdesk to maintain
my references, and each time I need to cite a paper, I first paste it in the paper where I need it,
and then paste the same thing in another text document.  After I finish writing the paper, I do a
search and replace command to turn \cite into \nocite, and insert it into my paper.  I recommend
putting it after your \bibliography command but it's up to the user. After that do a command + T,
command + Shift + B, then command + T (2x) and it should work.


Bibliography management
=======================
There are numerous BibTex database management solutions (Papers, BibDesk, etc.).  BibDesk ships
with TexShop, so is a commonly used package for Mac users. J. Sick has developed an Applescript
for automating the addition of bibliographies to your database, as well as automatically
downloading the PDF of the paper.  Current page: [1] Old page: [2].
