Hyperref package.


Creating hyperlinks in a LaTeX document is essential.
The best way to do this is use the hyperref package.

The package derives from, and builds on, the work of the HyperTEX
project, described at http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/.  It extends
the functionality of all the LATEX cross-referencing commands
(including the table of contents, bibliographies etc) to produce
\special commands which a driver can turn into hypertext links;
it also provides new commands to allow the user to write ad hoc
hypertext links, including those to external documents and URLs.

Include hyperref package
========================
%%
%% Hyperref package for embedding URLs for clickable links in PDFs, 
%% also specify PDF attributes here.
%%
%% FIXME: Blue hyperlinks would be nice.  Not certain which option actually
%%        does this.
%%
%% The pdfborder={0 0 0} is what ellimated the blue box around the url
%% displayed by \href{}{}.
%%
%% The command pdfborder={0 0 1} would display a box with thickness of 1 pt.
