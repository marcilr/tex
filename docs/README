hyperlinks.txt
  Hyperref package.

  Creating hyperlinks in a LaTeX document is essential.
  The best way to do this is use the hyperref package.

  The package derives from, and builds on, the work of the HyperTEX
  project, described at http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/.  It extends
  the functionality of all the LATEX cross-referencing commands
  (including the table of contents, bibliographies etc) to produce
  \special commands which a driver can turn into hypertext links;
  it also provides new commands to allow the user to write ad hoc
  hypertext links, including those to external documents and URLs.

include.txt
  There are two different commands to incorporate another file into
  the source of some document,  \input and \include.  When should
  I use one or the other?  What are the differences between them?
  Are there more things like them to be aware of?

  Include macros in LaTeX macro path?

  One of my long outstanding questions is how to pull directories
  with arbitrary macros into the LaTeX macro path for inclusion.
  Seems I've figured this out a couple times.
