Footnotes in captions


While working on the DVR requirements LaTeX document,
at 00PROJ/dvr/requirements/requirements.tex,
I had need of a footnote at the end of a caption.

I actually found two solutions.


I. Footnotes in captions are especially tricky: they present
problems of their own, on top of the problems one experiences
with footnotes in section titles (footnotes migrating to the
list of figures or tables, or apparently random errors because
\footnote is a fragile command), and with footnotes in tables
(typically, the footnote simply disappears).  Fortunately, the
requirement for footnotes in captions is extremely rare: if
you are experiencing problems, it is worth reviewing what you
are trying to say by placing this footnote: other options are
to place text at the bottom of the float, or to place a
footnote at the point where you refer to the float.

If you are going to proceed:
o use an optional argument in your \caption command, that
  doesn't have the footnote in it; this prevents the footnote
  appearing in the "List of...", and

o put your whole float in a minipage so as to keep the
  footnotes with the float. 

so we have:

    \begin{figure}
      \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
        ...
        \caption[Caption for LOF]%
          {Real caption\footnote{blah}}
      \end{minipage}
    \end{figure}

tex.ac.uk/

I tried the above which almost works.  However, the footnote
appears at the bottom of the figure (not at the bottom of the
page), not what I wanted.

II. Ultimately I used \footnotetext and \footnotemark to place
    the footnote in the caption.
