Footnotes in tables


The standard LaTeX \footnote command doesn't work in tables;
the table traps the footnotes and they can't escape to the
bottom of the page.

If your table is floating, your best bet is (unfortunately) to put
the table in a minipage environment and to put the notes underneath
the table, or to use Donald Arseneau's package threeparttable
(which implements "ctable notes" proper).

The ctable package extends the model of threeparttable, and also
uses the ideas of the booktabs package. The \ctable command does
the complete job of setting the table, placing the caption, and
defining the notes. The "ctable" may consist of diagrams,
and a parameter in \ctable's optional argument makes the float
that is created a "figure" rather than a "ctable".

Q: Footnotes in tables: Using a \footnote command within a
table gives the footnote superscript, but no footnote text appears.
A: Put the tabular bit of the table inside a minipage environment:

 \begin{table}[htp]
 \centering
 \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
 ....
 \end{tabular}
 \end{minipage}
 \caption{...}
 \end{table}

The footnote text is printed under a short line above the
table's caption. In a 2-column-per-page document, use
{0.5\textwidth} instead.

With quite a bit of experimentation perhaps the best way to
get footnotes in tables is to use \footnotemark and
\footnotetext. If course the problem here is that the
footnote number is not specified it must be tracked
manually. It does work to get good looking footnotes in
the tables though.

Used in WRT54Gl-config.tex:

In table:
\footnotemark[1]

Below table:
  \footnotetext[1]{Linksys \texttt{wrt54gl-ug.pdf}, p. 6}

"Footnotes in a minipage environment are handled in a way that is
particularly useful for putting footnotes in figures or tables.
A \footnote command puts the footnote at the bottom of the minipage
instead of at the bottom of the page, and it uses the mpfootnote
counter instead of the ordinary footnote counter. If you want the
footnote in a minipage environment to be placed at the bottom of
the actual page, in the usual fashion, use the \footnotemark and
\footnotetext commands."
