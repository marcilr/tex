<h1>LaTeX Tricks</h1>
<p>LaTeX is capable of most things but not always in the most obvious
manner. Here are some useful tricks that you might struggle to find in
the documentation. I'm not trying to teach you LaTeX there are two
routes to that 1) read Lamport's book (or something similar) and 2)
deconstruct other peoples documents and then try writing your own.</p>

<a name="programs"><h3>Dynamically Including Program Listings</h3></a>
You have written the perfect program <em>wonderful.cc</em> and want to
include it your report. Well you could do
<pre>\begin{verbatim}
-- Copy and paste your program to here --
\end{verbatim}
</pre>
However what happens when you suddenly find that your program has a
bug or would be even better with some tweak. Then you would have to
delete the copy from your report and repaste the new version. In
preference you can use the <em>verbatim</em> package. This allows you
to have a file printed in verbatim format (ie. looking like a
typewriter) at the chosen point of your report.
At the head of your document (somewhere before
<pre>\begin{document}</pre> put the line
<pre>\usepackage{verbatim}
</pre>
Then in the relevant location put
<pre>\verbatiminput{/hame/perfect/wonderful.cc}
</pre>
Now if you change your program rerun LaTeX will produce your report
with the updated program.
<a name="rotate"><h3>Rotating Tables and Figures</h3></a>
<p>You want to include the amazing results that you achieve with the
program you wrote. No problem, just put them in a table. Unfortunately
with all the conditions and outputs that you need to include you find
that the table is to wide for the page. You need to find a way to show
it in landscape format whilst leaving the rest of your document
alone. Enter the <em>rotating</em> package. As before put
</p><pre>\usepackage{rotating}
</pre>
in the head of your document. This allows you to rotate text, tables
and figures in every manner that your liable to want. To create the
table use the <tt>sidewaystable</tt> instead of <tt>table</tt>. For
example (lifted from the file rotating.tex in the package documentation).
<pre>\begin{sidewaystable}

Dates; For a breakdown of the Pottery Assemblages see Tables I and

Table V.}\label{rotfloat2} \end{sidewaystable} </pre> This method puts
the table on a page on it's own. This is probably what you want if
your table is that wide. If however you don't want it on a separate
page this can be achieved using the <tt>sideways</tt> and
<tt>rotcaption</tt> in conjunction with the standard <tt>table</tt>
command. See the examples file
(/usr/local/tex/texmf/doc/latex/rotating/examples.tex on my system)
for details.<p></p>
<p>There are a couple of points worth noting. The table will not
appear rotated when you look at the resultant dvi file. You need to
convert it to postscript to see it. This happens automatically when
you print it but should you want to preview it use the command
<tt>dvips [filestem] -o</tt>. So for the file <tt>report.dvi</tt>
enter <tt>dvips report -o</tt>. The other is that if you intend to
print the final report two sided then it if you include
<tt>twoside</tt> in the document class definition then the table should
be oriented the correct way depending on whether the page is odd or
even. So for example
</p><pre>\documentclass[a4paper,12pt,twoside]{article}
</pre>
<p>The command <tt>sidewaysfigure</tt> works similarly. If you use the
<tt>epsfig</tt> package to include eps files then there is another
method for rotating the diagram without changing the caption. This can
be achieved by, for example:
</p><pre>\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \begin{center}
    \epsfig{figure=test.eps, angle=67}
    \caption{Test}
    \label{fig:test}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
</pre>
<a name="maths"><h3>Maths Tricks</h3></a>
<p>If you have to type much in the way of maths it is worth
investigating the AMS-LaTeX packages. Being designed by the American
Mathematical Society they cover pretty much anything you are ever
likely to need if it isn't provided by the standard LaTeX
commands. There is very full documentation should be available on your
system (/usr/local/tex/texmf/doc/latex/amslatex/amsldoc.dvi on my
installation).</p>
<p>If you have tried to include text in an equation environment then
you'll have found that the result is italicised and there are no
spaces (unless you explicitly include them). The best way to do this
is to use the <em>amstext</em> package (so
<tt>\usepackage{amstext}</tt>) and then you can write
</p><pre>$f(x)=\sum_{n&gt;o}{\frac{x}{n^2}}=3 \text{ if the moon is full and } x &lt; 5$
</pre>
and other such pearls of wisdom. If you need a maths symbol and don't
know it or have the manual handy look at the file
<tt>/hame/iangl/public/latex_maths.dvi</tt> which includes most of
them (I think).<p></p>
<a name="wordcount"><h3>Doing wordcounts</h3></a>
<p>There is no particularly good way (that I know of) to do wordcounts
of a LaTeX document. However within certain limits (which you'd have
to be particularly obtuse to violate) the following works reasonably.
</p><pre>detex [filename] | wc -w
</pre>
And that's all folks.
